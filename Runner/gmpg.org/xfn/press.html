Many of these languages are related to content aggregation; others, such as XFN, are used to tag relationships between people and people.</p><p>...</p><h2>XFN</h2><p>XFN is the acronym for <em>XHTML Friends Network</em>. Developed by MatthewMullenweg (who also is the developer of the semantic blogging softwareWordPress) along with standards evangelists Eric Meyer and Tantek &Ccedil;elik,XFN is conceptually like other aggregation technologies, except it uses HTMLvocabulary, not other markup languages. </p><p>Mullenweg looks to the simplicity of XFN as one of its most appealing points.<q>I think there are a couple of really exciting things about XFN,</q> hesays. <q>It leverages higher-level semantics into the HTML everyone alreadyknows. You don&#039;t have to learn a new awkward syntax or mess with strangefiles. It takes what you&#039;re already doing, linking, and enriches itsemantically.</q></p><p>By adding a number of attribute values to the <code>rel</code> attribute, anyone writing documents in HTML or XHTML can make their links XFN-friendly.Here&#039;s an example of a link on one of my site&#039;s pages to BizStone&#039;s web site:</p><pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizstone.com/&quot;    title=&quot;Go to http://www.bizstone.com&quot;    rel=&quot;friend colleague&quot;&gt;Biz Stone&lt;/a&gt;.</code></pre><p>As you can see, I added the <code>rel</code> attribute to the link and also added values that describe our relationship as being friends and colleagues. Beyond simple, but sure to be very effective when blogrolls, specialty search engines, blogging tools, and markup editors begin supporting XFN more explicitly.</p><p>The other piece of XFN that Mullenweg points to as having tremendouspotential is that XFN is distributed, unlike social networking web sites.<q>XFN doesn&#039;t tie you in to any one place; it connects people acrossdomains, literally,</q> Mullenweg says. <q>The history of the Web has shownthat decentralization is the wave of the future.</q></p><h3>NOTE</h3><p>Learn all about XFN on the<a href="index.html">XHTML Friends Network</a> site.</p></blockquote></li><li>20031229 Seattle Times: <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001824979_paul29.html/">Social networking beginning to take shape on the Web</a> by Paul Andrews<blockquote cite="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001824979_paul29.html/"><p>For Web loggers, XFN &#151; the XHTML Friends Network &#151; enables coding links to other bloggers with a "rel" (relationship) tag. With enough participation, tagging eventually can permit virtual friendship-building.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p style="margin-top:5em;text-indent:0"><a href=".html">Back to the XFN home page</a>.</p><div id="trail"><a href=".html">XFN</a> [<a href="http://gmpg.org/">GMPG</a>]</div><div id="footer"><p id="copyright">Copyright &copy; 2003 GMPG.  <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/1.0/">Some rights reserved</a>.</p></div></body>
